## Notes from tweaking models

### Speed model
	- Using image descaled by 1/2 and huv colour space
		○ Val_loss = 0.1379
	- Using top 2/3rds of image descale fx,y = 0.6 and RGB, batch=128
		○ - loss: 0.1258 - accuracy: 0.9652
	- Using top 2/3rds of image descale fx,y = 0.6 and huv, batch=64
		○ - loss: 0.1150 - accuracy: 0.9594
	- Using top 2/3rds of image descale =1 and huv, batch=64
		○ - loss: 0.1191 - accuracy: 0.9623
	- Using top 2/3rds of image descale =0.7 and huv, batch=64
		○ loss: 0.1142 - accuracy: 0.9601
	- Using top 2/3rds of image descale =0.8 and huv, batch=64
